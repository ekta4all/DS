Arrays--> collection of elements having same type of data

int a[5];

for(i=0;i<5;i++)
{
printf("\n enter the element");
scanf("%d",&a[i]);
}

Search--->

Linear Search
Binary Search


Step 1: Enter the array

Step 2: Logic to find the element in an array

step 3: Print the element found or not found
